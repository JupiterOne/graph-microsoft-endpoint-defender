    "description": "Summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (\`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION\`) to ask for data to send, even when the \`CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a \`PUT\` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is (expected to be) changed from a PUT to a POST. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. A use-after-free flaw was found in the Curl package, which may lead to unintended information disclosure by the application. Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in curl, including issues with validating certain certificate wildcards, handling callbacks, and saving cookies to files. The vulnerabilities could result in information disclosure, denial of service, or local file creation or overwrite. The impact of these vulnerabilities is multiple issues in curl. The specific versions to upgrade to are: libcurl4-gnutls-dev - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1, libcurl4-openssl-dev - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1, libcurl3-gnutls - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1, libcurl4-doc - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1, libcurl3-nss - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1, libcurl4-nss-dev - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1, libcurl4 - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1, curl - 7.58.0-2ubuntu3.24+esm1. Package updates are available for Amazon Linux 2 that fix the vulnerabilities, including issues with POST-after-PUT confusion, IDN wildcard match, SSH server's public key verification, and an integer overflow vulnerability. The impact of these vulnerabilities is multiple issues in curl. A patched version of the package is available for Mariner.

    "description": "Summary: The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack. This vulnerability is also known as the "NSEC3" issue. Another vulnerability in BIND allows a remote attacker to cause CPU exhaustion on a DNSSEC-validating resolver by flooding it with queries. Additionally, BIND is vulnerable to parsing large DNS messages, validating DNSSEC messages, reverse zone queries, and specific recursive query patterns, all of which can lead to denial of service attacks.

    "description": "Summary: The HTTP/2 protocol is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack known as the Rapid Reset attack. This attack allows a client to cancel a large number of requests immediately after sending them, causing the server to perform unnecessary work and consume resources. The attack takes advantage of the ability to unilaterally cancel requests using the RST_STREAM frame, leaving the HTTP/2 connection open. This vulnerability has been exploited in the wild between August and October 2023. Multiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected, including .NET, nghttp2, swift-nio-http2, and helm. A known exploit exists for this vulnerability. Impact: If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected server. The server may become overwhelmed with the processing of canceled requests, leading to resource exhaustion and unavailability of services. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. AdditionalInformation: This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-44487. It is important to note that the Rapid Reset attack relies on an asymmetry between the server and the client, where the server incurs significant processing costs for canceled requests while the client pays minimal costs. This makes the attack particularly effective in overwhelming server resources. Generated by AI",

This vulnerability, known as the "KeyTrap" issue, allows remote attackers to cause CPU consumption by sending DNSSEC responses with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records. Another vulnerability, known as the "NSEC3" issue, allows attackers to cause CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations by sending DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack. These vulnerabilities can lead to a DoS condition by exhausting CPU resources and stalling DNS resolvers. Impact: If these vulnerabilities are exploited, a remote attacker can exhaust CPU resources and stall DNS resolvers, resulting in a denial of service. This can disrupt DNS services and impact the availability of network resources. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. AdditionalInformation: These vulnerabilities have been assigned CVE-2023-50387 and CVE-2023-50868.
