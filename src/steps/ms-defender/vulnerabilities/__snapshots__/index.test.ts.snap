            "description": "Summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (\`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION\`) to ask for data to send, even when the \`CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a \`PUT\` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is (expected to be) changed from a PUT to a POST. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. A use-after-free flaw was found in the Curl package, which may lead to unintended information disclosure by the application. Multiple vulnerabilities were fixed in curl, including issues with validating certain certificate wildcards, handling callbacks, and saving cookies to files. The vulnerabilities could result in information disclosure, denial of service, or local file creation or overwrite. The impact of these vulnerabilities is multiple issues in curl.

      "description": "Summary: An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (\`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION\`) to ask for data to send, even when the \`CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS\` option has been set, if the same handle previously was used to issue a \`PUT\` request which used that callback. This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer. The problem exists in the logic for a reused handle when it is (expected to be) changed from a PUT to a POST. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to misbehave and either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in the second transfer.

      "description": "Summary: OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service attack due to a flaw in the DH_check(), DH_check_ex(), and EVP_PKEY_param_check() functions. These functions are used to check DH keys or DH parameters, and applications that use them may experience long delays when checking excessively long keys or parameters. If the keys or parameters are obtained from an untrusted source, this vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service condition. The issue affects the efficiency of key and parameter checks, rather than directly compromising the security or integrity of cryptographic operations. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. Impact: A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request using long DH keys or parameters, causing long delays and resulting in a denial of service condition.

            "description": "Summary: GLib is vulnerable to a slowdown issue in GVariant deserialization, which can lead to denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the g_variant_byteswap() function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by persuading a victim to open specially crafted content, resulting in a denial of service. Impact: The vulnerability allows for a denial of service attack, compromising application availability by consuming excessive processing time or utilizing a large quantity of memory. The most likely threat is from a local user, but a remote attack is possible if the application is configured to read GVariants over a network connection. Remediation: Upgrade to the following package versions: libglib2.0-0 - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-data - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-tests - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-doc - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-bin - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-dev - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-dev-bin - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3. For Fedora, update to glib2-2.74.7. AdditionalInformation: The most widely available attack vector is local, and the consequences are limited to denial of service.

      "description": "Summary: GLib is vulnerable to a slowdown issue in GVariant deserialization, which can lead to denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the g_variant_byteswap() function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by persuading a victim to open specially crafted content, resulting in a denial of service. Impact: The vulnerability allows for a denial of service attack, compromising application availability by consuming excessive processing time or utilizing a large quantity of memory. The most likely threat is from a local user, but a remote attack is possible if the application is configured to read GVariants over a network connection. Remediation: Upgrade to the following package versions: libglib2.0-0 - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-data - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-tests - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-doc - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-bin - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-dev - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3, libglib2.0-dev-bin - 2.56.4-0ubuntu0.18.04.9+esm3. For Fedora, update to glib2-2.74.7. AdditionalInformation: The most widely available attack vector is local, and the consequences are limited to denial of service. The likelihood of a remote attack is low, as it requires the application to be configured to read GVariants over a network connection. Generated by AI",

The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent. This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system. cURL libcurl could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a TELNET option IAC injection flaw. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to pass on user name and "telnet options" for the server negotiation. Red Hat's versions of the associated software have been determined to NOT be affected by CVE-2023-27533. Harry Sintonen discovered multiple vulnerabilities in curl, including improper handling of TELNET connection options, special tilde characters in SFTP paths, reuse of FTP, SSH, and GSS connections. These vulnerabilities could lead to credential reuse, circumvention of filtering, and unauthorized access. The recommended solution is to update the system to the latest package versions. For Ubuntu, run \`sudo pro fix USN-5964-1\` to fix the vulnerability. For Amazon Linux AMI, package updates are available. For Fedora, the vulnerabilities have been fixed in the latest version of curl. For Mariner, an upgraded version of the package is available to resolve the vulnerability.

      "description": "Summary: A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl <8.0 during communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on maliciously crafted user name and "telnet options" during server negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent. This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system. cURL libcurl could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by a TELNET option IAC injection flaw. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to pass on user name and "telnet options" for the server negotiation. Red Hat's versions of the associated software have been determined to NOT be affected by CVE-2023-27533. Harry Sintonen discovered multiple vulnerabilities in curl, including improper handling of TELNET connection options, special tilde characters in SFTP paths, reuse of FTP, SSH, and GSS connections. These vulnerabilities could lead to credential reuse, circumvention of filtering, and unauthorized access. The recommended solution is to update the system to the latest package versions. For Ubuntu, run \`sudo pro fix USN-5964-1\` to fix the vulnerability. For Amazon Linux AMI, package updates are available. For Fedora, the vulnerabilities have been fixed in the latest version of curl. For Mariner, an upgraded version of the package is available to resolve the vulnerability. Impact: If exploited, these vulnerabilities in curl could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, bypass security restrictions, reuse credentials, circumvent filtering, and gain unauthorized access to systems. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. Generated by AI",

The recommended remediation is to upgrade to OpenSSH version 9.3p2 or later. It is also advised to start ssh-agent with an empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist or configure an allowlist with specific provider libraries to prevent exploitation. No workaround is provided. Please refer to the respective advisories for more information. Impact: The vulnerability in OpenSSH's ssh-agent allows remote code execution, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compromise of the entire system. Remediation: Apply the latest patches and updates provided by the respective vendors. AdditionalInformation: This vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2016-10009). It is important to take immediate action to upgrade OpenSSH to the recommended version and implement the suggested security measures to mitigate the risk of exploitation. Generated by AI",
